## Second Iteration of my personal portfolio :fire:
The aim of this iteration is to showcase a portfolio with code as its main theme while maintaining a clean and attractive design. The reason behind this design shift was finding myself loving working on the backend as much as I did in the frontend, so I tried to create a porfolio that showcased both characteristics. This is the result.

## Future Feature Ideas
* Add a page for each project to explain the project in more detail and add what I've learned building them
* Framer Motion animations to improve its presentation

## Currently working on
* Making it completely responsive
